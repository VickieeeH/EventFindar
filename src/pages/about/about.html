      Eventfinda and the Ministry for Culture and Heritage are working together in a unique partnership to bring you New Zealand’s most comprehensive events calendar. This partnership combines Eventfinda’s world-class technology with the Ministry for Culture and Heritage’s in-depth cultural knowledge, content and editorial expertise. The aim of the partnership is to make cultural events and attractions visible and accessible to the largest possible audience.

      The Ministry’s role will include acting as the first port of call for the many users in the cultural sector submitting events to Eventfinda.co.nz. The events listing service for cultural providers will remain free. The Ministry will also be developing new content to provide richer and more in-depth coverage of what’s happening around the sector in New Zealand.
      You can find out more about the work of the Ministry at www.mch.govt.nz, and check out some of its websites at Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, www.teara.govt.nz, and New Zealand History Online, www.nzhistory.net.nz.
